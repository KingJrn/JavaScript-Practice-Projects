# JavaScript-Practice-Projects
Although this project is entirely Javascript based, I used Vanilla Javascript, Jquery, scss, and Bulma CSS in building this project. For styling, I use scss and bulms css.
If you are trying this out, make sure to include the bulma cdn. check: https://bulma.io/documentation/overview/start/ for it.
